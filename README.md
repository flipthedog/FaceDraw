# Face Draw
Draw your face.

## Abstract
A python program that will convert an image to a G-code file that you can run on a 3D printer.

## But How?
The intention of this program is to allow you to draw your face, or anything else, with a 3D printer or similar hardware. Simply strap a pen or marker
to your machine toolhead and a piece of paper to your print surface and run the generated g-code file.

On the software side this project relies heavily on OpenCV for image processing as well as a bit of slicer code to generate a G-code file.

## Work in Progress
Still working on getting this to work

# Supported Firmware
Right now this program will only support the **RepRap firmware** flavor. However, that list will hopefully grow soon.
