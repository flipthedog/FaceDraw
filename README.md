# Face Draw

This will convert an image to a G-code file that you can run on a 3D printer.

The intention of this program is to allow you to draw your face with a 3D printer or similar hardware. Simply strap a pen
to your machine head and a piece of paper to your surface and run the generated g-code file.

# Supported Firmware
Right now this program only supports G-code generation in the RepRap firmware flavor.
